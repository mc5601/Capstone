Capstone (Fall 2025) â€” Environmental Data Analysis

Field measurements for air quality (PM2.5) and sound quality.

What this project does

Connects to a shared Google Drive folder with UPAS log files.

Reads each log, cleans errors, and extracts PM2.5.

Combines everything into a single table for analysis.

Lets you plot PM2.5 vs time by date/hour.

Setup
1) Install Python packages
pip install pydrive2 oauth2client pandas numpy matplotlib

2) Get the JSON key

To participate, you need a Google Drive service-account JSON key. Ask MARTIN CELEDON for this file.

Save it outside the repository (never put it in GitHub):

Windows: C:\Users\<you>\capstone_credentials.json

macOS/Linux: /Users/<you>/capstone_credentials.json (or /home/<you>/capstone_credentials.json)

3) Set the environment variable

macOS/Linux

export CAPSTONE_SA_JSON=~/capstone_credentials.json


Windows (PowerShell)

$env:CAPSTONE_SA_JSON = "C:\Users\<you>\capstone_credentials.json"

How to run

Open AQ_2.ipynb in JupyterLab/Notebook.

Run all cells in order.

The notebook uses CAPSTONE_SA_JSON to connect to Google Drive and load the data.
